# FooBar as a React app

In this repository you'll find the stuff you need to get started.

Clone the repo, and run the following commands to get started

`npm install`

and then it's `npm start` as usual.

## Your Task

See how far you can get, create a few components (I have supplied a simple one for you)

The FooBar.getData() is already set up (linked in index.html) so you're good to go

I probably wouldn't work too much with animations, they are a bit different in React, and we didn't cover that yesterday

So... Take one thing at a time. Create some components, show some lists, and add a few funny things :-)
